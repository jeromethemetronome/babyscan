Repository for the Babyscan project - 3D scanning helmet for 3D imaging and automated diagnosis of plagiocephaly.


10 Ecole Polytechnique and ESCPI students gathered for a 3-week group project aiming at digitizing diagnosis of plagiocephaly. We built a helmet able to take photos from a moving baby for 3D imaging. A Matlab Runtime executable runs a Matlab code able to fix coordonnates of points of interest and establish a horizontal plane. Then, head perimeter and skull deformation are automatically calculated for several planes.
